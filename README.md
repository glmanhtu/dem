Generation of a 3D object from a Digital Elevation Model
===================


Digital Elevation Models (**DEMs**) are 2D maps in which each point is associated with its height. They can be obtained through techniques such as photogrammetry, lidar, land surveying, etc. They represent the elevation of a terrain map. This project will generate 3D object from DEM files.

----------


Objectives
-------------

The main objective of this project is to implement a software able to : o Import DEM files from various formats
                     
- Visualize them in 3D (with rotations, translations and zooms along the axis)
- Allow the user to resize or to crop them using boundary boxes
- Create a support at its basis to transform it into a 3D object
-  Add a fonctionnality to label it on (or below its support)
- Export the result in OBJ and STL formats
